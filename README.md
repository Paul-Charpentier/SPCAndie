# dLWPCA

Here is my code to filter out the telluric in W1, the first component wPCA of the differential line width (dLW) data from lbl

This notebook book is analysing a toy model of this contamination on a simulated EV Lac data. 
The analysis on true data will be published in a comming paper (Charpentier et al. in prep.) 

Feel free to use this code on your own research (but citing me will be nice of you :) )
